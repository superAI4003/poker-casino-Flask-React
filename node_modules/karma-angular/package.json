Just install this framework and it will scan your package.json,\nfind all your angular dependencies, and make sure they are being served up by karma.\n\nAs an added bonus: If you decide to add/remove an angular module later,\njust `npm install --save` or `npm remove --save` it. Your karma config does not need to change.\n\n*Note: This is only works for official angular modules released by the Angular team*\n\nInstall karma-angular\n--------------------\n```\nnpm install --save-dev karma-angular\n```\n\nInstall desired angular-dependencies via npm\n--------------------------------------------\n```\nnpm install --save-dev angular-mocks\nnpm install --save angular angular-route\n```\n\nSet Up Your karma.conf.js\n-------------------------\n```javascript\nmodule.exports = function(karma){\n  karma.set({\n    // register the framework (it needs to go before mocha / jasmine)\n    frameworks: ['angular', 'mocha'],\n\n\n    files: [               // no need to enter paths for angular / angular-mocks\n      \"src/**.js\",         // your package.json is scanned and they will be automatically\n      \"test/**-test.js\"    // prepended to this array.\n    ],\n\n    browsers: ['PhantomJS']\n  });\n};\n```\n\nIf the automatic scanning is not working for you, you can force which modules are included with an\narray of strings as shown below. This really is not recommended, as it's not really saving you any work\n(just use the files array at this point) and you lose out on managing those dependencies entirely from\n`npm install` / `remove`. Provided mostly as a way for you to hot-fix if angular releases a new module you\nneed **right now** and I have not white listed it yet. If that is the case, please create an issue, or\nbetter yet write up a quick Pull Request on [the white-list in this file](https://github.com/jamestalmage/karma-angular/blob/master/index.js).\n\n ```javascript\nmodule.exports = function(karma){\n  karma.set({\n    frameworks: ['angular', 'mocha'],\n\n    // you can use the full name (i.e. 'angular-mocks', or just shorten it to 'mocks')\n    angular: ['mocks', 'route', 'angular-aria'],\n\n    files: [\n      \"src/**.js\",\n      \"test/**-test.js\"\n    ],\n\n    browsers: ['PhantomJS']\n  });\n};\n```\n\nIf for some reason you need further examples, one can be found\n[here](https://github.com/jamestalmage/karma-angular/tree/master/example).\n\n",
